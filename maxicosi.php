				<h2>The Case</h2>

				<p>I was asked to come up with a solution for Maxi-Cosi's Mico Max 30â„¢ customization page. The requirements included designing a mobile friendly tool that would organize and display all the customization options available to users while still remaining simple to non-power users (ie: tired mothers/fathers and people over 40). I was also required to stay within the Maxi-Cosi branding guidelines and development limits. </p>

				<h2>The Branding</h2>
				<p>I began by consolidating any branding information I had in one document. I stayed in line with Maxi-Cosi's soft and childlike branding by selecting Omnes Pro as playful but modest font.</p>

				<span role="description">Branding Style Tile.</span>

				<h2>The Design</h2>
				<p>Once styling was finalized I moved on to designing the user interface. A vertical tabbing system set apart the types of materials and color options while a horizontal tabbed slider showed accessories and toys. I decided to provide information on these extra options by allowing the user to hover over the content and replace the main image with a short description. This turned out to be a great solution for saving real estate above the fold. Any material and color selections would update the photo on the page per requirements.
